        <p>Every year, the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development publishes their “How is Affordable Housing Threatened in Your Neighborhood?” annual report. The report brings together multiple datasets to evaluate which New York City neighborhoods are currently facing the most threats to affordable housing, and what factors have played a role in this endangerment. The one released in 2021 showcased an undeniable display of inequality, as the 5 most endangered neighborhoods in the city were all situated in the Bronx. The following map showcases which community districts were the most impacted, and what factors played a role in their current state.
